# Web Servers

## Overview 

This project is an example of basic static file serving web servers written in the following languages:
- Node.js
- Python (3.6+)
- Java
- Ruby 

I wanted to make this project to showcase that once you understand the concepts of programming, the only thing you need to learn is the syntax of a language to use it for a project. 

Also, I was bored.

Each server will listen for HTTP requests on port `8080` of your local machine, and then use the `static` folder to serve content requested.

## Project Structure

The website files are currently being hosted in the `static` folder. 

Other folders outside of `static` are language specific web servers for handling requests and server the files in the `static` folder. 

In order to spin up a server, change directories into the server folder (`nodejs`, `python`, `etc`) and run the commands listed in the respective folder's `README` file.
